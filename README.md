# KBC_Cpp
A quiz game called KBC (similar to ; Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?). We (Nishant and myself) developed this game as our 12th grade project in 2016.

There are two rounds in the game; in the first round multiple players can play. A couple of questions are asked to each number of players and the player with the fastest time proceeds to the main game.
In the main game, the player has three lifelines if he/she gets stuck in the game. 

The questions for the main round are stored individually in a text file named as ALPHABETq.txt where ALPHABET can run from a to z (can be updated in the code). The answers to these questions are stored in a separate file called ans.txt where they are formated as ALPHABET# where ALPHABET corresponds to the letter used to represent the question and # represents the right answers ( 1,2,3 or 4).
As a counter there is a array called amount which keeps a track of the hypothetical money that the player has won.

It is a simple game and a simple code which can be optimised.
